Key Factors in Language Model Performance

Parameter Size Matters:

Large models like GPT-4o: 1.75 trillion parameters

Smaller models like Mistral v0.3 Instruct: 7 billion parameters

Impact of Size:

Larger models retain significantly more domain-specific and general knowledge.

Smaller models (SLMs) often lack depth in domain-specific expertise.

SLM Phase One Observations

Struggles with Specific Knowledge:

Example: In-game currency knowledge for the Minecraft game is weak.

Prompt Engineering Challenges:

Adding detailed information in prompts, such as specifying in-game currencies like Minecraft emeralds or other domain-specific examples, compensates for the lack of knowledge.

Results in:

Longer Prompts: Increased latency.

Limited Effectiveness: Still struggles with reasoning tasks.

Implications

Latency Trade-off:

More detailed prompts = slower response times, as the number of input tokens to models will increase, leading to longer model inference times.

Reasoning Deficiency:

Limited reasoning capabilities hinder effective problem-solving, as adding details in the prompt does not guarantee that models will effectively use the information, and it is impractical to include exhaustive details about every game in the prompt.
