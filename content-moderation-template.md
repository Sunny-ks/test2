## Input Format

The content to be moderated will be provided as text. You should analyze the full content for any possible violations.

## Output Format

Your response must be in the following format:

```
id, rule
```

Where:
- `id` is the category_id plus rule number (e.g., "hr_h1" for harassment high rule 1)
- `rule` is the exact text of the violated rule

## Examples

### Example 1: Safe Content

**Input:**
"I really enjoyed playing this game yesterday. The graphics and story were amazing!"

**Output:**
```
sf, Content appears safe
```

### Example 2: Single Violation

**Input:**
"Does anyone know where I can buy a gaming account? I'll pay $50 for a good one."

**Output:**
```
sp_h1, Exchange or buying for account (acc or accs) or items (e.g., 'Selling my gaming acc for $50', 'I want to buy a gaming account I will pay $10.')
```

### Example 3: Multiple Violations

**Input:**
"You're such an idiot. I hope your account gets hacked and you lose everything. People like you ruin this game."

**Output:**
```
hr_m1, Uses mild profanity to mock or shame traits
hr_m7, Encourages or wishes non-physical harm or distress to others
```

## Important Guidelines

1. Be precise in identifying rule violations
2. Use the exact rule ID and text from the provided rules database
3. When in doubt about severity, choose the higher severity level
4. Consider context carefully before flagging content
5. Do not over-moderate or flag content unnecessarily
6. For borderline cases, consider if the content falls under any exceptions

## Performance Optimization

To improve efficiency:

1. First categorize the content into broad categories (spam, harassment, violence, etc.)
2. Then check specific rules within the identified categories
3. Always check high-severity rules first, then medium, then low
4. Use the exact rule IDs and text from your training data
5. Be consistent in your output format

Remember, your goal is to accurately identify rule violations while minimizing both false positives and false negatives. Maintain the exact "id, rule" format in all responses.
