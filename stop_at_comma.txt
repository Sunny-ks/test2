Great question! Let’s break it down step by step. 🔍

### **How Autoregressive Models Generate Tokens**
Your **fine-tuned Mistral v0.3 model** generates text **one token at a time** in an **autoregressive manner**. This means that:
1. It **predicts the next token** based on the input and previously generated tokens.
2. Each token is chosen based on the probability distribution over the vocabulary, given the past context.

Since you trained the model on `"Label, explanation"`, it has **learned** that:
- The **first part** should be the **correct label**.
- The **second part** (after `,`) should contain an **explanation**.

### **What Happens During Inference?**
When you prompt the model and stop generation **at the comma**, the model **still internally reasons** about why it is choosing a specific label.

Here's what happens:
1. The model processes your input **in full** (system prompt + user query).
2. It computes **hidden states** that capture contextual information from fine-tuning.
3. When generating the first token (the **label**), it has already **implicitly considered the explanation** because it was fine-tuned to expect one.

💡 **Key Insight:**  
- The model **does not blindly pick a label**—it selects `"A"` with an **understanding** of why `"A"` is the correct answer.
- However, since decoding is **stopped at the comma**, you just don’t get to see the explanation that influenced that decision.

### **Analogy: Choosing an Answer Without Justifying It**
Think of a multiple-choice test where you're asked:

> **Question:** What is the best classification for this review?  
> a) Positive  
> b) Negative  
> c) Neutral  

If someone trained you to **always provide an answer + justification**, you might think:
> "The review contains words like 'excellent' and 'fantastic,' so the sentiment is clearly positive. I’ll write: Positive, because the words indicate strong approval."

But now, imagine you are told:
> "Just give the answer. Stop writing after the first comma."

Even though you **only write** "Positive," your brain **still processed the full reasoning** before choosing it.

This is exactly what happens in your model! 🧠✨

### **Why This Works in Your Case**
- **Fine-tuning taught the model** that after the label, an explanation should follow.
- **During inference, it still reasons about the explanation**, even though it doesn’t get to output it.
- **Stopping at the comma doesn’t prevent reasoning—just prevents decoding beyond that point.**

---

### **Final Thought**
Your model isn't "guessing" the label without understanding.  
It is **selecting the label based on its learned knowledge**, which includes the reasoning—it's just that you don't let it output the reasoning in text.

Would you like me to run an experiment to verify this behavior using log probabilities? 🚀
