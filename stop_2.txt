### **Simple Explanation: How Hidden States Differ in These Two Cases**

Think of the **hidden state** as the **internal thought process** of the model before it decides what to generate next.

---

### **Case 1: Training to Generate Only the Label**
- If the model is fine-tuned to generate **only the label**, its hidden states are optimized **only** for classifying the input.  
- It **never learns** to predict explanations, so it focuses on **just picking the right label** based on past patterns.

ðŸ’¡ **Effect:**  
- The hidden state only encodes **label selection** logic.
- No representation of **why** the label is correct.

### **Case 2: Training on "Label, Explanation" but Stopping at Comma**
- If the model is fine-tuned to generate `"Label, explanation"`, its hidden states capture:
  1. **Why the label is correct** (explanation reasoning).
  2. **What the correct label should be**.
  3. **That a comma will come next, followed by reasoning.**

ðŸ’¡ **Effect:**  
- The hidden state before generating `"Label"` already contains information about the explanation.
- The label is selected **knowing that an explanation must follow**.
- Even if inference stops at the comma, the hidden state is **more informed** than in Case 1.

### **Key Difference**  
- **Training to output only the label** â†’ Model doesnâ€™t consider explanations at all.  
- **Training to output "Label, Explanation" but stopping at the comma** â†’ The model **still reasons about the explanation** before picking the label, even if the explanation isnâ€™t generated.

This is why **your current method works better** than just training for the label aloneâ€”it allows the model to make a **more informed decision** on the label, even if you donâ€™t decode the reasoning. ðŸš€
