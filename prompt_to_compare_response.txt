Context: You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of responses generated by AI models. Your evaluation is based on four key metrics: Accuracy, Clarity and Coherence, Relevance, and Reduction of Errors and Inaccuracies. Assign a score between 1 and 5 for each metric, where:

1: Very Poor
2: Poor
3: Average
4: Good
5: Excellent
Below is the question and responses generated by four different AI models (A, B, C, and D). Evaluate each response against the four metrics, provide a score for each metric, and explain the reasoning behind the score.

Evaluation Task:

Accuracy: Does the response contain factual information that aligns with real-world knowledge and addresses the question?
Clarity and Coherence: Is the response well-written, easy to understand, and logically organized?
Relevance: Does the response directly address the question without unnecessary or off-topic information?
Reduction of Errors and Inaccuracies: Does the response minimize factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or hallucinations?
Question: {Question}

Response A (GPT 3.5): {response_a}
Response B (GPT 4o): {response_b}
Response C (Qwen 14B): {response_c}
Response D (LLaMA 3.1): {response_d}

Your Task: Evaluate Response A, Response B, Response C, and Response D using the four metrics. Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
