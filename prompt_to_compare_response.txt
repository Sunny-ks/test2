Context: You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of responses generated by AI models. Your evaluation is based on four key metrics: Accuracy, Clarity and Coherence, Relevance, and Reduction of Errors and Inaccuracies. Assign a score between 1 and 5 for each metric, where:

1: Very Poor
2: Poor
3: Average
4: Good
5: Excellent
Below is the question and responses generated by four different AI models (A, B, C, and D). Evaluate each response against the four metrics, provide a score for each metric, and explain the reasoning behind the score.

Evaluation Task:

Evaluation Metrics and Definitions
Accuracy:

Definition: Measures whether the response contains factual and reliable information that aligns with real-world knowledge and directly addresses the question.
High Score (5): The response is factually correct, complete, and free of any misleading or incorrect statements.
Low Score (1): The response contains significant factual inaccuracies, is misleading, or does not provide valid information.
Clarity and Coherence:

Definition: Evaluates how well the response is written, structured, and organized. This includes readability, grammar, and logical flow of ideas.
High Score (5): The response is easy to read, grammatically correct, and logically structured, with a natural and coherent progression of ideas.
Low Score (1): The response is difficult to read, poorly organized, or contains significant grammatical and structural issues.
Relevance:

Definition: Assesses how directly and fully the response addresses the question without including unnecessary, off-topic, or redundant information.
High Score (5): The response is highly focused on the question, providing precise and relevant details without any digressions.
Low Score (1): The response is largely off-topic, includes irrelevant content, or fails to address the question meaningfully.
Reduction of Errors and Inaccuracies:

Definition: Evaluates whether the response minimizes errors, inconsistencies, and hallucinations (nonsensical or fabricated information).
High Score (5): The response is entirely free of factual or logical errors, hallucinations, or contradictions.
Low Score (1): The response contains major inaccuracies, contradictions, or fabricated information that significantly undermine its quality.
